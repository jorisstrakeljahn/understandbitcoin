  - Nodes are computers that validate every Bitcoin transaction
  - Running a node means you verify the rules yourself — no trust required
  - There are 50,000+ nodes worldwide
  - Anyone can run a node on a Raspberry Pi
  - Nodes enforce the rules that even miners must follow
whyPeopleAsk: People hear that Bitcoin is "decentralized" but want to understand what that means technically. Nodes are the answer.
steelmanObjection: "Most people don't run nodes, so Bitcoin depends on a small number of node operators. This isn't truly decentralized — it's just differently centralized."
whatIsTrue:
  - Nodes verify every transaction against consensus rules
  - Anyone can run a node with modest hardware
  - Nodes enforce rules that miners must follow
  - The network has tens of thousands of nodes globally
whatIsUncertain:
  - The exact number of nodes (many are behind firewalls)
  - What minimum node count is "enough" for security
  - Whether node operation will remain accessible as blockchain grows

## What Is a Node?

A Bitcoin node is a computer running Bitcoin software that:
1. **Stores** a complete copy of the blockchain (all transactions ever)
2. **Validates** every new transaction and block against the rules
3. **Broadcasts** valid transactions and blocks to other nodes
4. **Rejects** anything that breaks the rules

Think of nodes as the accountants of Bitcoin — they independently verify that every transaction is legitimate.

## Types of Nodes

### Full Nodes

The most important type. A full node:
- Downloads and stores the entire blockchain (~500+ GB)
- Validates every transaction from the beginning
- Doesn't trust any other node — verifies everything independently

**Requirements**: Modest computer (Raspberry Pi works), 500+ GB storage, internet connection.

### Archival Nodes

Full nodes that also serve historical data to other nodes. Most full nodes are archival by default.

### Pruned Nodes

Full nodes that validate everything but delete old blockchain data after validation. Requires less storage (~10 GB) but still validates everything.

### Light Nodes (SPV)

Simplified Payment Verification nodes that only download block headers. They trust full nodes for transaction data. Less secure but practical for phones.

### Mining Nodes

Full nodes that also participate in mining. They create new blocks in addition to validating.

## Why Nodes Matter

### Don't Trust, Verify

Bitcoin's slogan isn't just marketing. When you run a node, you:
- Verify your own transactions (no trusting an exchange or service)
- Confirm the total supply (no hidden inflation)
- Enforce the rules (no one can cheat, not even miners)

Without your own node, you're trusting someone else to tell you the truth about Bitcoin.

### Decentralization

With 50,000+ nodes worldwide, there's no single point of failure. To attack Bitcoin, you'd have to attack thousands of independent computers across the globe.

### Rule Enforcement

Here's the crucial point: **nodes don't just follow rules — they enforce them**.

If miners try to create a block with invalid transactions, nodes reject it. If miners try to create extra Bitcoin, nodes reject it. Miners work for the network, not the other way around.

## The 2017 Block Size War: Nodes in Action

In 2017, a group of major companies and miners wanted to change Bitcoin's rules (larger blocks). They had over 80% of mining power.

But node operators didn't accept the change. The miners' blocks were rejected by the network. The attempted change failed.

This proved that nodes — not miners — are the ultimate authority in Bitcoin. Mining power means nothing if nodes don't accept your blocks.

## Running Your Own Node

### Why Run a Node?

- **Privacy**: Don't leak your transactions to third parties
- **Verification**: Know your Bitcoin is real, your balance is correct
- **Support the network**: More nodes = more decentralization
- **Vote with code**: Your node enforces the rules you believe in

### What You Need

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Computer | Raspberry Pi 4 | Any modern PC |
| Storage | 500 GB SSD | 1+ TB SSD |
| RAM | 2 GB | 8+ GB |
| Internet | Basic broadband | Unlimited data |

Cost: $200-400 for a dedicated setup, or free on existing hardware.

### Popular Options

**Bitcoin Core**: The reference implementation. Full featured, well tested.

**Umbrel/Start9**: User-friendly packages that run Bitcoin Core plus other apps.

**Raspberry Pi nodes**: Cheap, low-power, always-on solutions.

## The Network

### Current State

As of 2025:
- **50,000+** reachable nodes worldwide
- **100,000+** estimated total (many behind firewalls)
- Every continent represented
- Diverse hardware and software implementations

### Geographic Distribution

Nodes exist everywhere from major data centers to apartments in developing countries. This distribution makes Bitcoin resilient to regional attacks or regulations.

### The Blockchain Size Challenge

The blockchain grows ~50-100 GB per year. This is a concern:
- More storage required
- Longer initial sync time
- Higher barrier to entry

However:
- Storage costs drop faster than blockchain grows
- Pruned nodes reduce requirements
- Solutions like Utreexo aim to reduce footprint further

## Common Misconceptions

### "Mining is what makes Bitcoin work"

Mining creates blocks and processes transactions. But nodes enforce the rules. Without nodes accepting their blocks, miners are just wasting electricity.

### "You need a node to use Bitcoin"

You can use Bitcoin through wallets that connect to other people's nodes. But you're trusting those nodes to be honest. Running your own removes this trust.

### "Nodes are only for technical people"

Modern node software (Umbrel, Start9) is plug-and-play. If you can set up a Roku, you can run a node.

## The Philosophy

Running a node embodies Bitcoin's ethos:

- **Sovereignty**: You verify the rules yourself
- **Independence**: You don't trust third parties
- **Participation**: You're part of the network, not just a user
- **Responsibility**: You help enforce the rules you believe in

This is what "be your own bank" means in practice — not just holding your own keys, but validating the entire system yourself.

## The Honest Assessment

Nodes are essential but imperfect:

**Strengths**:
- Enable true verification without trust
- Distribute power away from miners
- Create resilience through redundancy

**Challenges**:
- Blockchain growth increases requirements
- Most users still use light wallets
- Running a node requires some effort

Bitcoin would benefit from more people running nodes. But even with current numbers, the network is significantly more decentralized than any alternative — fiat or crypto.
