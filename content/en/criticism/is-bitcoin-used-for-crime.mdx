## Yes, Criminals Use Bitcoin. So What?

Yes, some criminals use Bitcoin. But this isn't the gotcha that critics think it is.

Criminals also use US dollars - overwhelmingly the currency of choice for drug cartels worldwide. They use the internet for fraud, coordination, and recruitment. They use smartphones for encrypted communications. They use cars for getaways and trafficking. They use banks for money laundering, as billions in fines against major financial institutions repeatedly prove.

The question isn't whether criminals use something - they use every valuable tool. The real question is whether the tool is primarily criminal, and whether its legitimate uses outweigh its misuse.

## What the Data Actually Shows

According to Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analysis firm, illicit cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2023 was approximately $24.2 billion. That sounds like a lot until you realize it represents just 0.34% of total crypto transaction volume. The vast majority - 99.66% - was entirely legitimate.

For comparison, the United Nations estimates that 2-5% of global GDP is laundered annually, amounting to $800 billion to $2 trillion. This money flows primarily through the traditional banking system, not cryptocurrency. Major banks pay billions in money laundering fines with depressing regularity. HSBC paid $1.9 billion in 2012. Deutsche Bank paid $630 million in 2017. Standard Chartered has paid hundreds of millions multiple times. The list goes on.

The historical trend in Bitcoin is actually encouraging. In 2019, approximately 2.1% of transactions had illicit associations. By 2020, that had dropped to around 0.34%, where it has remained. As Bitcoin has grown, legitimate use has outpaced criminal use by an ever-widening margin.

| Metric | Bitcoin | Traditional Banking |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Illicit transaction share | ~0.34% | 2-5% of global GDP |
| Transaction transparency | Fully public ledger | Private records |
| Law enforcement tools | Blockchain analysis | Subpoenas, investigations |
| Fines for major players | Not applicable | Billions annually |

## Why Bitcoin Is Actually Bad for Criminals

Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin often makes criminal enterprise harder, not easier.

Consider the fundamental nature of Bitcoin's blockchain. Every single transaction is recorded permanently on a public ledger. Anyone in the world can examine it. Every transfer from every address to every other address is visible forever. Contrast this with cash - a briefcase full of hundred-dollar bills leaves no trace. No blockchain. No record. No trail.

Law enforcement has developed sophisticated tools to trace Bitcoin transactions. Companies like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and CipherTrace specialize in following money across the blockchain, connecting addresses to identities, and tracking funds through complex laundering schemes. Exchange KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements create identity links when criminals try to cash out. Tainted coins from known criminal wallets become increasingly difficult to use as the ecosystem matures.

The results speak for themselves. Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road dark marketplace, was caught partly through blockchain analysis. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attackers saw most of their bitcoin recovered by the FBI precisely because the transactions were traceable on a public ledger. The Bitfinex hackers were caught years after their crime through patient chain analysis, despite elaborate attempts to hide their tracks.

The on-ramps and off-ramps present another challenge for criminals. To use Bitcoin, they must convert cash to cryptocurrency at some point, typically through exchanges that maintain identity records. Eventually, they must convert back to usable currency - another chokepoint with surveillance opportunities. These transitions are where law enforcement catches most crypto criminals, not because Bitcoin failed to hide them, but because truly anonymous conversion is remarkably difficult.

## The Privacy Coin Question

If Bitcoin is too traceable, why don't criminals simply use Monero or other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies?

Some do. But privacy coins present their own challenges for illicit use. They have far less liquidity than Bitcoin, making large amounts harder to move without affecting prices. Fewer merchants and services accept them. Converting to usable fiat currency is more difficult. And they're increasingly delisted from major exchanges precisely because of regulatory pressure around their privacy features.

Bitcoin's network effects make it useful - and that usefulness extends to criminals just as it extends to everyone else. But the same network effects that make Bitcoin valuable also make it increasingly visible and traceable.

## Confronting the Ransomware Problem

Ransomware is perhaps the strongest version of the "Bitcoin enables crime" argument, and it deserves honest engagement.

Ransomware attacks often specifically demand Bitcoin. The attacks have increased significantly in recent years. They target hospitals, schools, and critical infrastructure - causing real harm beyond financial losses.

But context matters here too. Bitcoin actually enabled recovery in several high-profile cases. The Colonial Pipeline ransom was largely recovered precisely because Bitcoin is traceable - something that would have been impossible with cash payments. Pre-Bitcoin, ransom was paid in wire transfers and prepaid gift cards. The attack vector existed independently of Bitcoin; only the payment method changed.

Interestingly, ransomware groups have increasingly moved toward requesting Monero when possible, precisely because Bitcoin is too traceable for their purposes. This trend suggests that Bitcoin's transparency is a bug, not a feature, from the criminal perspective.

Better security practices and reduced willingness to pay ransoms have decreased attack profitability. The ecosystem is adapting, and not in ways that favor criminals.

## A Thought Experiment Worth Taking Seriously

Consider some parallel cases. Encryption technology is used by terrorists to communicate securely - should we ban encryption? Cash is the overwhelmingly preferred medium for drug transactions - should we eliminate physical currency? Cars are used in robberies and for human trafficking - should we ban automobiles? Kitchen knives are used in stabbings - do we need knife control?

Every powerful technology can be misused. We don't judge technologies solely by their worst use cases, and we shouldn't start with Bitcoin.

The honest question is: do the legitimate uses outweigh the criminal uses? For Bitcoin, the data suggests they do by an enormous margin. 99.66% of use is legitimate. Banks demonstrably facilitate more money laundering. Bitcoin's unique properties - censorship-resistance, fixed supply, permissionless access - provide genuine value to millions of people. And the percentage of criminal use continues to decline.

## Acknowledging What's Actually True

Let's steelman the criticism honestly, without dismissing it.

Bitcoin does make certain crimes easier. Cross-border ransomware payments are simpler than coordinating wire transfers. Donations to sanctioned entities can evade traditional banking blocks. Pseudonymous value transfer enables things that fully transparent banking prevents.

These are real issues that deserve attention. Pretending they don't exist is intellectually dishonest.

But the same properties that enable these crimes also enable other things. Dissidents in authoritarian regimes can receive donations when their bank accounts are frozen. The unbanked - 1.4 billion adults worldwide - can access financial services. Citizens in countries with capital controls can protect savings from confiscation. People in economies with hyperinflation can preserve wealth.

Whether these trade-offs are worth it is ultimately a value judgment. Reasonable people can disagree. But it's not as simple as "Bitcoin = crime." The same features that serve criminals also serve the oppressed. The technology doesn't distinguish; how we evaluate it depends on what we value.

## Correcting Common Misconceptions

The belief that Bitcoin is anonymous is perhaps the most damaging misconception. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous. Every transaction is public. With sufficient analysis, identities can often be linked to addresses. The blockchain is the opposite of hidden - it's the most transparent financial system ever created.

The claim that most Bitcoin is used for crime is simply false. The data shows the opposite - less than 1% of transactions have illicit associations, a lower percentage than traditional finance.

The idea that Bitcoin created new crimes conflates the tool with the behavior. Ransomware, fraud, and money laundering existed long before Bitcoin. The specific mechanisms evolve; the underlying criminal motivations are ancient.

And the assertion that law enforcement can't track Bitcoin is contradicted by case after case where blockchain analysis led to arrests, convictions, and fund recovery. The public ledger is a feature for investigators, not a bug.

## The Bottom Line

Criminals use Bitcoin. They also use everything else that's useful.

The relevant questions are specific: Is criminal use a significant percentage of Bitcoin transactions? No - approximately 0.34%. Is Bitcoin more criminal than alternatives? No - banks facilitate more money laundering by any measure. Is Bitcoin making crime easier overall? Debatable - the traceability actually helps law enforcement. Do legitimate uses outweigh criminal uses? The data strongly suggests yes.

Bitcoin is a neutral technology. It doesn't care who uses it, just as dollars, knives, and the internet don't care. Judging it only by criminal use ignores the 99%+ of users who are simply trying to save, transact, and protect their wealth in ways the traditional financial system doesn't always allow.

The question isn't whether bad people use Bitcoin. The question is whether the world is better or worse for Bitcoin's existence. That's worth thinking about honestly, without the reflexive assumption that tools used by criminals must be criminal tools.
