tldr:
  - Founded in Vienna in the 1870s by Carl Menger
  - Focuses on individual human action, not mathematical models
  - Values are subjective — there's no "intrinsic value"
  - Free markets coordinate information better than central planners
  - Explains why sound money (like Bitcoin) matters for society
whyPeopleAsk: Many Bitcoiners reference Austrian Economics when explaining why Bitcoin matters. People want to understand this intellectual tradition and how it connects to cryptocurrency.
steelmanObjection: "Austrian Economics is just an ideology for libertarians, not a real science. It rejects mathematics and empirical testing, making it unfalsifiable and unscientific."
whatIsTrue:
  - Austrian Economics uses deductive logic rather than statistical modeling
  - It has correctly predicted several economic crises (including 2008)
  - Its insights about money and credit cycles are highly relevant to Bitcoin
  - Major economists like Hayek won Nobel Prizes
whatIsUncertain:
  - Whether its methodology is superior to mainstream economics
  - How applicable its theories are to modern complex economies
  - The extent to which pure free markets are desirable

## A Different Way of Thinking About Economics

Austrian Economics isn't about Austria — it's named after the nationality of its founders. In the 1870s, Carl Menger in Vienna developed a radically different approach to understanding economics, one that would influence generations of thinkers including Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek.

While mainstream economics tries to model the economy like physics — with equations and statistical predictions — Austrian economists argue this fundamentally misunderstands what an economy is.

## Core Principles

### 1. Methodological Individualism

The economy isn't a machine. It's millions of individual humans making choices. To understand economic phenomena, you must understand human action — what Mises called "praxeology."

There's no such thing as "the economy deciding" something. Only individuals decide and act.

### 2. Subjective Value

Things don't have inherent, objective value. A glass of water is worthless to someone drowning but priceless in a desert. Value exists only in the minds of individuals making choices.

This insight — revolutionary in the 1870s — explains why labor doesn't determine value (why a hole dug and filled creates no value) and why central planners can't calculate optimal prices.

### 3. Knowledge Problem

No central authority can gather and process all the information needed to run an economy. Prices in free markets aggregate the dispersed knowledge of millions of participants. Central planning must fail because planners lack this information.

This is Hayek's most famous contribution.

### 4. Time Preference

People generally prefer goods now over goods later. The degree of this preference — your time preference — profoundly affects economic behavior, savings, and civilization itself.

Low time preference leads to investment, capital accumulation, and growth. High time preference leads to consumption and stagnation.

### 5. Austrian Business Cycle Theory

When central banks artificially lower interest rates, they distort the economy's price signals. Businesses make investments that seem profitable but aren't sustainable. Eventually, reality reasserts itself — causing recessions.

This theory predicted the 2008 financial crisis when mainstream economists missed it.

## Why Bitcoin Resonates

Austrian Economics explains why Bitcoiners care about:

**Sound Money**: The Austrians showed how government manipulation of money distorts the economy and transfers wealth. Bitcoin offers an alternative.

**Fixed Supply**: Austrian theory explains why predictable monetary policy matters more than flexible, discretionary policy.

**Decentralization**: The knowledge problem shows why distributed systems outperform central control — whether in economies or in money.

**Voluntary Exchange**: Austrian economists emphasize that value comes from voluntary trades, not coercion. Bitcoin enables uncensorable voluntary exchange.

## The Critique

Austrian Economics isn't without critics:

- It rejects mathematical modeling that dominates modern economics
- Some call it "unfalsifiable" because it uses logical deduction rather than empirical testing
- It's associated with libertarian politics, making some dismiss it as ideological

These criticisms have merit. But the Austrian insights about money, credit, and the limits of central planning remain valuable — especially for understanding why Bitcoin matters.

## Key Thinkers

| Economist | Contribution | Key Work |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Carl Menger | Marginal utility, subjective value | Principles of Economics (1871) |
| Ludwig von Mises | Praxeology, business cycle theory | Human Action (1949) |
| Friedrich Hayek | Knowledge problem, spontaneous order | The Road to Serfdom (1944) |
| Murray Rothbard | Anarcho-capitalism, money theory | Man, Economy, and State (1962) |

## The Connection to Bitcoin

Bitcoin is often called "Austrian Economics in code." It embodies core Austrian principles:

- **Fixed supply**: No central bank can inflate it
- **Market-determined value**: Price emerges from voluntary exchange
- **Decentralized knowledge**: No single entity controls it
- **Sound money**: Hard to produce, easy to verify

Understanding Austrian Economics helps you understand why Bitcoin is designed the way it is — and why its advocates believe it matters.
