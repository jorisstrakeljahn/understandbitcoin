## Your Money Is Melting

Inflation means your money buys less over time. The coffee that cost $1 a decade ago costs $2 now. The house your parents bought for $50,000 would cost $500,000 today. Your savings account balance hasn't changed, but its purchasing power has declined significantly.

This isn't natural economic law. Prices didn't always rise. For most of the gold standard era, prices in 1900 were similar to prices in 1800. Inflation became a constant feature of life only after governments abandoned commodity money and gave central banks the power to create unlimited currency.

Understanding inflation - what causes it, who benefits, who loses, and how it's measured - reveals why some people consider sound money like Bitcoin essential rather than optional.

## Two Ways to Think About Inflation

In everyday speech, inflation means "prices going up." When groceries cost more than last year, people say there's inflation. This is how governments measure and report it - tracking a basket of goods called the Consumer Price Index and calculating how much prices changed.

Austrian economists define inflation differently: as expansion of the money supply. Rising prices are the consequence, not the thing itself. This distinction matters because prices can rise for different reasons. An oil embargo raises prices. A pandemic disrupting supply chains raises prices. Money printing also raises prices. The causes are different; the cures should be different too.

The Austrian definition points to a simple mechanism. When more money exists to buy the same amount of goods, each unit of money is worth less. Double the money supply and, all else equal, prices eventually double. The money itself has been diluted, like watering down wine.

This mechanism operates with a lag. Central banks create money, which flows through the banking system, then to corporations and eventually to consumers. Prices adjust gradually as the new money circulates. The delay makes it easy to blame price increases on other factors - greed, supply chains, speculators - while obscuring the monetary cause.

## The Numbers You See Versus the Reality You Feel

The government reports Consumer Price Index inflation at 2-4% in normal times, with spikes during unusual periods like 2021-2022. But many people feel their costs rise much faster. This gap isn't imaginary.

Housing is the most glaring disconnect. CPI uses "owners equivalent rent" - what homeowners would hypothetically pay to rent their own homes - rather than actual home prices. When house prices rise 50%, CPI barely registers the increase. Yet housing is the largest expense for most families.

Healthcare costs have risen dramatically faster than official CPI. Medical care has become simultaneously more expensive and more essential. The official statistics use quality adjustments - since treatments have improved, the price increase is discounted. But your actual medical bills don't care about hedonic adjustments.

Education follows a similar pattern. College tuition has increased over 1,200% since 1980 - far outpacing any measure of general inflation. A credential that your parents bought with summer job earnings now requires six-figure debt.

Asset prices don't appear in CPI at all. When stocks, bonds, and real estate appreciate, that's not "inflation" by official measures. But assets are where newly created money often flows first, enriching those who already own assets while making them increasingly unaffordable for those who don't.

The discrepancy between official inflation and lived experience has fueled significant distrust. When the government says inflation is 3% but your rent, healthcare, and children's tuition have doubled in a decade, the official number feels like gaslighting.

## The Tax You Never Voted For

Inflation functions as a tax, but one that was never debated, never approved, and never appears on any receipt.

When the government needs money, it can tax citizens openly - a visible, democratic process. Or it can print money, which dilutes the value of everyone's existing currency. The result is the same: purchasing power transfers from citizens to government. But one method requires political courage and the other is nearly invisible.

Consider a concrete example. You have $10,000 in savings. The government prints enough money to cause 10% inflation. Your savings still show $10,000, but they now buy only $9,000 worth of goods. You've effectively lost $1,000 to the inflation tax. No vote was taken. No receipt was issued. The money just buys less.

This tax falls heaviest on those who save in cash - often the elderly, the cautious, and the financially unsophisticated. Those who understand the game convert savings into assets that appreciate with inflation. Those who don't watch their purchasing power erode year after year.

## Winners and Losers

Inflation is not neutral. It systematically transfers wealth from some groups to others.

Debtors benefit because debts are fixed in nominal terms. If you owe $100,000 and inflation halves the dollar's value, you effectively owe $50,000 in real terms. This is why governments - the world's largest debtors - like inflation. It erases their debts without explicit default.

Asset owners benefit because real assets appreciate with inflation. Stocks, real estate, commodities, businesses - their values rise as the currency falls. Those who own assets get richer. Those who earn wages or hold cash fall behind.

First receivers of new money benefit through the Cantillon Effect. Banks, corporations, and those with access to cheap credit receive money before prices adjust. They buy assets at old prices. By the time money reaches workers' wages, prices have already risen.

Savers lose because cash holdings decline in purchasing power. The prudent person who puts money aside for emergencies watches their security erode annually. The inflation tax is a penalty on financial responsibility.

Workers lose because wages typically lag prices. Employers don't automatically increase pay when prices rise. Workers must negotiate, job-hop, or accept declining real compensation. The disconnect between wage growth and asset price growth since 1971 is stark.

Future generations lose by inheriting inflated prices for housing, education, and everything else their parents bought more cheaply, plus the debt accumulated through inflationary finance.

## When Inflation Becomes Hyperinflation

Inflation is concerning at 5% or 10%. At 50% per month, civilization breaks down.

Hyperinflation occurs when trust in a currency collapses and people race to exchange money for anything real before it loses more value. Prices rise daily, then hourly. Workers demand payment in the morning so they can spend before prices rise by afternoon. Money becomes worthless faster than it can be printed.

| Country | Year | Peak Monthly Inflation |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| Hungary | 1946 | 41,900,000,000,000,000% |
| Zimbabwe | 2008 | 79,600,000,000% |
| Venezuela | 2018 | 2,700,000% |
| Weimar Germany | 1923 | 29,500% |

These aren't ancient history. Venezuela's hyperinflation is ongoing. Argentina struggles with triple-digit annual inflation. Zimbabwe recovered only to face renewed currency crisis.

Hyperinflation typically follows a pattern: government needs money, can't or won't tax enough, prints to cover deficits, public loses trust, printing accelerates to cover accelerating prices, total collapse follows. The pattern is well understood, yet it keeps happening because governments keep facing the same temptation.

Every fiat currency is vulnerable. The dollar hasn't hyperinflated because trust remains. But trust is not permanent, and the conditions that cause hyperinflation - massive debt, political dysfunction, inability to fund obligations honestly - are not absent from developed countries.

## The Defense of Moderate Inflation

Central bankers and mainstream economists argue that some inflation is actually healthy. Their arguments deserve fair consideration.

A small inflation rate lubricates the economy, they say. It's psychologically easier to give workers 0% raises when prices rise 2% than to cut wages 2% when prices are stable. This wage stickiness argument has empirical support - nominal wage cuts are rare even when they'd be economically efficient.

Moderate inflation encourages spending and investment, the argument continues. If money loses value sitting idle, you're incentivized to put it to productive use. Deflation, by contrast, might cause people to hoard money, reducing economic activity.

Inflation provides central bank policy room. When rates are positive, the Fed can cut them to stimulate during recessions. At zero rates, this tool is exhausted. Some inflation keeps rates higher and preserves policy flexibility.

Finally, inflation eases debt burdens for governments, businesses, and homeowners. Gradual devaluation makes fixed debts more manageable over time.

These arguments aren't frivolous. The gold standard era featured severe deflations that caused genuine suffering. But they must be weighed against inflation's costs - wealth transfer, inequality, savings erosion, moral hazard, and the risk that "moderate" inflation becomes less moderate.

## Bitcoin's Alternative

Bitcoin offers something that seemed impossible before 2009: money with an absolutely fixed supply that no authority can inflate.

The 21 million cap is enforced by mathematics and consensus, not by policy promises. Every node on the network verifies that the rules are followed. No committee can vote to increase the supply. No emergency can justify printing more.

| Dimension | Fiat Money | Bitcoin |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Supply limit | None | 21 million |
| Annual inflation | 2%+ by policy | Trending toward 0% |
| Supply determination | Central bank discretion | Algorithmic schedule |
| Changeability | Instant, by decision | Requires global consensus |

If Bitcoin works as intended, it's money that can't be inflated. Your share of the total supply can never be diluted without your consent. The inflation tax cannot reach you.

This doesn't mean Bitcoin is a perfect inflation hedge today. Its price is volatile, rising and falling dramatically over short periods. The correlation with inflation expectations is imperfect. The 15-year track record is encouraging but not long enough to prove the thesis definitively.

What's clear is that Bitcoin's design makes supply inflation structurally impossible, while fiat makes it structurally inevitable. Whether the former works better than the latter is the experiment currently underway.

## The Bottom Line

Inflation erodes your purchasing power continuously, operating as a tax you never voted for and transfers wealth in ways that are rarely discussed openly.

Official measurements likely understate inflation's true impact on typical households. Housing, healthcare, and education - the categories that matter most - have risen far faster than headline CPI suggests.

Bitcoin offers an alternative: money with a fixed supply that cannot be inflated by any authority. Whether this makes it a good investment, a useful hedge, or a revolutionary monetary technology depends partly on execution and partly on time horizons we're still living through.

Understanding inflation means understanding why some people consider fixed-supply money not just interesting but essential. When your savings can be diluted at will by people you never elected, holding money that can't be diluted becomes more than a financial strategy. It becomes a form of protection.
