## What Happens at a Halving?

Every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), Bitcoin's block reward is automatically cut in half.

| Halving | Date | Block Reward | New BTC/Day |
|---------|------|--------------|-------------|
| Genesis | Jan 2009 | 50 BTC | ~7,200 |
| 1st | Nov 2012 | 25 BTC | ~3,600 |
| 2nd | Jul 2016 | 12.5 BTC | ~1,800 |
| 3rd | May 2020 | 6.25 BTC | ~900 |
| 4th | Apr 2024 | 3.125 BTC | ~450 |
| 5th | ~2028 | 1.5625 BTC | ~225 |

The block reward is how new bitcoins enter circulation. When it halves, the rate of new supply drops by 50%.

## Why Does It Happen?

The halving is coded into Bitcoin's protocol. Satoshi Nakamoto designed it this way for several reasons:

### Controlled Supply

Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, Bitcoin has a predictable, decreasing issuance schedule. The halving is the mechanism that ensures the 21 million cap is approached gradually.

### Fairness

If all 21 million bitcoins had been created immediately, early participants would have owned everything. The halving extends distribution over 130+ years, giving more people time to participate.

### Incentive Transition

As block rewards decrease, transaction fees become more important for miner revenue. This transitions Bitcoin from a "subsidy-funded" security model to a "fee-funded" one.

## The Supply Shock Effect

### Simple Economics

When new supply decreases and demand stays constant or increases, price tends to rise. The halving creates a supply shock:

**Before halving**: 900 BTC/day of new supply
**After halving**: 450 BTC/day of new supply

If buyers want the same amount as before, they're competing for half the newly available supply.

### Historical Patterns

Every halving has been followed by a significant bull market:

| Halving | Price at Halving | Peak After | Gain |
|---------|------------------|------------|------|
| 2012 | ~$12 | ~$1,100 (2013) | ~9,000% |
| 2016 | ~$650 | ~$19,000 (2017) | ~2,800% |
| 2020 | ~$9,000 | ~$69,000 (2021) | ~660% |

**Caveat**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Each cycle has shown diminishing percentage returns.

## The "Priced In" Debate

Critics argue the halving can't affect price because:

### Efficient Market Hypothesis

Everyone knows the halving is coming. Rational markets should price in known future events. By the time the halving arrives, its effect should already be reflected.

### Diminishing Impact

Each halving affects a smaller percentage of total supply:

| Halving | New Supply as % of Total |
|---------|-------------------------|
| 2012 | ~25% reduction in total |
| 2016 | ~12% reduction in total |
| 2020 | ~6% reduction in total |
| 2024 | ~3% reduction in total |

### The Counterargument

But markets aren't always efficient, especially with a novel asset class. And even small supply changes can have large price effects when:
- Demand is growing
- Much existing supply is held long-term ("HODLed")
- The narrative attracts new participants

## What Happens to Miners?

The halving cuts miner revenue in half overnight (in BTC terms). This creates challenges:

### Marginal Miners Shut Down

If electricity costs exceed revenue, miners turn off. Historically, hashrate (total mining power) drops temporarily after halvings before recovering.

### Efficiency Pressure

Miners must become more efficient or access cheaper energy. This drives innovation in mining technology and energy sourcing.

### Price Pressure

If miners need to sell Bitcoin to cover costs, reduced block rewards mean less selling pressure from miners — potentially bullish for price.

### Long-Term Sustainability

Eventually, transaction fees must sustain miner revenue. Whether fees will be sufficient is an open question addressed over the coming decades.

## The Next Halvings

| Halving | Estimated Date | Block Reward | ~Supply Mined |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 5th | ~2028 | 1.5625 BTC | ~97% |
| 6th | ~2032 | 0.78125 BTC | ~98.5% |
| 7th | ~2036 | 0.390625 BTC | ~99.2% |
| Final | ~2140 | 0 BTC | 100% |

By 2036, over 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. The halvings become almost ceremonial at that point.

## Should You "Buy the Halving"?

There's no guaranteed strategy. Consider:

### Arguments for Buying Before

- Supply reduction creates scarcity
- Historical patterns suggest post-halving appreciation
- Narrative attracts new participants

### Arguments Against

- Already priced in
- Diminishing returns each cycle
- No guarantee history repeats
- Volatility means timing matters

### The Honest Take

The halving is a known, significant event. Smart money has multiple views. If you're investing in Bitcoin, the halving matters — but it's one factor among many.

## The Deeper Significance

Beyond price, the halving represents something profound:

**Predictability**: In a world of unpredictable monetary policy, Bitcoin's supply schedule is known for the next century.

**No Human Control**: Unlike central bank decisions, the halving happens automatically. No committee, no vote, no discretion.

**Decreasing Inflation**: Every halving makes Bitcoin "harder" — more resistant to supply inflation.

The halving isn't just a supply event. It's a demonstration that money can exist with rules that no one can change on a whim — rules that markets can plan around with certainty.
