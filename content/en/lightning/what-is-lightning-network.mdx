tldr:
  - Lightning enables near-instant Bitcoin payments
  - Fees are tiny (often fractions of a cent)
  - Works through payment channels secured by Bitcoin
  - Ideal for everyday purchases and micropayments
  - Increases Bitcoin's transaction capacity dramatically
whyPeopleAsk: People hear that Bitcoin is slow and expensive for small transactions. Lightning is the solution being built, and people want to understand how it works.
steelmanObjection: "Lightning is too complex for regular users, requires being online, and channels can fail. It's not ready for mainstream adoption."
whatIsTrue:
  - Lightning payments are genuinely fast and cheap
  - It's secured by Bitcoin's blockchain
  - Capacity and adoption are growing rapidly
  - User experience has improved significantly
whatIsUncertain:
  - Whether it will scale to billions of users
  - How routing will work at massive scale
  - Regulatory treatment of Lightning service providers

## The Scaling Problem

Bitcoin's base layer can process about 7 transactions per second. Visa handles thousands. For Bitcoin to work as everyday money, it needs to scale.

Lightning solves this without changing Bitcoin itself.

## How Lightning Works

### Payment Channels

Two people can open a "payment channel" by locking bitcoin in a special Bitcoin transaction. Once open, they can send payments back and forth instantly, updating who owns how much of the locked bitcoin.

When they're done, they close the channel with one final Bitcoin transaction.

### The Network Effect

Here's the clever part: you don't need a direct channel with everyone. If Alice has a channel with Bob, and Bob has a channel with Carol, Alice can pay Carol through Bob.

This creates a network where payments can route through multiple hops to reach anyone.

### Security

Lightning is secured by Bitcoin. If someone tries to cheat (claiming old balances), the other party can prove fraud and take all the funds. This makes cheating unprofitable.

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Payments confirm in milliseconds
- **Cost**: Fees are often under $0.01
- **Capacity**: Millions of transactions per second potential
- **Privacy**: Transactions aren't all recorded on-chain
- **Micropayments**: Pay fractions of a cent

## Current State

Lightning is live and growing:
- Thousands of BTC in channels
- Millions of users (especially in El Salvador)
- Used for everyday purchases, streaming sats, gaming

User experience has improved dramatically with modern wallets that handle the complexity behind the scenes.
