tldr:
  - Gold has 5,000+ years of track record; Bitcoin has 15
  - Bitcoin is easier to transport, divide, and verify
  - Gold exists physically; Bitcoin exists digitally
  - Both have limited supply (gold by geology, Bitcoin by code)
  - They may serve complementary rather than competing roles
whyPeopleAsk: Gold has been the traditional store of value for millennia. People want to understand if Bitcoin is a real competitor or something different entirely.
steelmanObjection: "Gold has survived empires, wars, and technological revolutions for 5,000 years. Bitcoin is a 15-year experiment that could fail tomorrow due to bugs, quantum computing, or government bans."
whatIsTrue:
  - Gold's track record is incomparably longer
  - Bitcoin has superior portability and divisibility
  - Both are scarce (but in different ways)
  - Both face unique risks
whatIsUncertain:
  - Whether Bitcoin's 21M cap is as "hard" as gold's scarcity
  - How each will perform in various crisis scenarios
  - Which will be preferred by future generations

## The Properties of Money

To compare Bitcoin and gold, we need a framework. Economists typically evaluate money by:

1. **Durability** - Does it last?
2. **Portability** - Can you move it easily?
3. **Divisibility** - Can you split it into smaller units?
4. **Fungibility** - Is each unit identical?
5. **Scarcity** - Is supply limited?
6. **Verifiability** - Can you prove it's real?

## How They Compare

### Durability
- **Gold**: Practically indestructible. Lasts thousands of years.
- **Bitcoin**: Lasts as long as the network exists. No physical degradation.

### Portability  
- **Gold**: Heavy and expensive to move. International transfers are complex.
- **Bitcoin**: Send any amount anywhere instantly. Carry billions in your head (seed phrase).

### Divisibility
- **Gold**: Difficult and expensive to divide into small amounts.
- **Bitcoin**: Divisible to 8 decimal places (satoshis). Even smaller on Lightning.

### Fungibility
- **Gold**: Highly fungible. One ounce equals another.
- **Bitcoin**: Somewhat less fungible due to transparent history. Being addressed.

### Scarcity
- **Gold**: Limited by geology. New supply ~1.5%/year. Unknown total reserves.
- **Bitcoin**: Limited by code. Known supply curve. Hard cap at 21 million.

### Verifiability
- **Gold**: Requires expertise or equipment to verify. Counterfeits exist.
- **Bitcoin**: Anyone can verify with a node. Perfect verification.

## The Real Question

Perhaps they're not competing. Gold has proven itself over millennia. Bitcoin offers something new: digital scarcity you can self-custody and transport trivially.

Many hold both - gold for its track record, Bitcoin for its superior monetary properties in a digital world.

## The Honest Assessment

Gold wins on: track record, physicality, no technological risk.
Bitcoin wins on: portability, divisibility, verifiability, programmability.

Your choice depends on your values, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
