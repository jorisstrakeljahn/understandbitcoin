tldr:
  - Transactions are signed with private keys (like a digital signature)
  - Nodes verify transactions are valid
  - Miners compete to add transactions to the blockchain
  - The blockchain is a shared record everyone can verify
  - Economic incentives keep the network secure
whyPeopleAsk: After learning what Bitcoin is, the natural next question is understanding the technology behind it - how can money work without a central authority?
steelmanObjection: "The technology is too complicated for average people to understand or use safely."
whatIsTrue:
  - The core protocol has worked securely since 2009
  - Transactions are mathematically verified
  - The network processes thousands of transactions daily
  - Anyone can run a node and verify everything
whatIsUncertain:
  - Whether the technology will scale for global adoption
  - How quantum computing might affect security

## The Core Components

Bitcoin combines several technologies that existed before it in a novel way:

### 1. Public Key Cryptography

Every Bitcoin user has a pair of keys:
- **Private key**: A secret number that lets you spend your bitcoin
- **Public key**: Derived from the private key, used to receive bitcoin

When you send bitcoin, you create a digital signature using your private key. Anyone can verify this signature using your public key, proving you authorized the transaction.

### 2. The Blockchain

The blockchain is a chain of blocks, each containing transactions. Every block references the previous one, creating an unbreakable chain back to the first block (the "genesis block").

This structure makes it practically impossible to change past transactions - you'd have to redo all the work for every subsequent block.

### 3. Mining and Proof of Work

Miners compete to add new blocks by solving a mathematical puzzle. The first to solve it gets to add the block and receives new bitcoin as a reward.

This process:
- Secures the network against attacks
- Creates new bitcoin at a predictable rate
- Reaches consensus without a central authority

### 4. The Network

Thousands of nodes (computers running Bitcoin software) maintain copies of the blockchain. They validate transactions and blocks, rejecting anything that breaks the rules.

## The Transaction Flow

1. You create a transaction and sign it
2. Your wallet broadcasts it to the network
3. Nodes verify it's valid
4. Miners include it in a block
5. The block is added to the blockchain
6. The recipient can now spend the bitcoin
