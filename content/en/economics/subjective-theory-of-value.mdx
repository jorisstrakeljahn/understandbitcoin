tldr:
  - Value is not objective or inherent in things
  - The same object has different value to different people
  - Value comes from satisfying human wants, not from labor or materials
  - This explains why Bitcoin can be valuable despite being "just code"
  - Central planners can't determine "correct" prices because value is subjective
whyPeopleAsk: Critics say Bitcoin has "no intrinsic value." Understanding subjective value theory reveals why this criticism misunderstands how value works.
steelmanObjection: "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value — it's just code. Unlike gold (used in jewelry and electronics) or dollars (backed by government), Bitcoin is backed by nothing."
whatIsTrue:
  - No object has objective, inherent value
  - Value always depends on individual preferences and circumstances
  - Bitcoin's value comes from its monetary properties, not physical backing
  - All valuable things are valuable because humans value them
whatIsUncertain:
  - The long-term stability of Bitcoin's subjective valuation
  - Whether digital scarcity will be valued as highly as physical scarcity
  - How Bitcoin's value will evolve as adoption changes

## The Revolution of 1871

Before Carl Menger, economists believed in "objective" theories of value. The labor theory of value, championed by Adam Smith and Karl Marx, held that a good's value came from the labor required to produce it.

This had an obvious problem: a mudpie requires labor, but nobody values mudpies.

Menger's insight was radical and simple: **value exists only in human minds**. An object has value because someone values it — period.

## Value Is Always Subjective

Consider water:
- To someone drowning: worthless, even negative value
- To someone in a desert: invaluable, worth more than gold
- To someone with a full glass: nearly worthless

The water hasn't changed. The circumstances have. Value isn't in the water — it's in the relationship between the water and a person's needs.

This applies to everything:
- A painting is worthless to someone blind to art, priceless to a collector
- A steak is worthless to a vegetarian
- A house is valued differently by someone with no family versus someone with children

**There is no "true" value waiting to be discovered. Value is created by human minds evaluating their circumstances.**

## The Marginal Revolution

Menger (along with Jevons and Walras independently) discovered that people don't value things in total — they value the next unit (the "marginal" unit).

The first glass of water after walking through a desert is worth a fortune. The tenth glass that day is worth almost nothing. You're not valuing "water" — you're valuing *this particular glass of water given your current situation*.

This "marginal utility" concept solved puzzles that plagued economics for centuries: Why are diamonds expensive but water cheap, when water is essential for life and diamonds are mere decoration?

Answer: Because we value the marginal unit. Water is abundant, so the next glass has little marginal value. Diamonds are scarce, so the next diamond is highly valued.

## Why "Intrinsic Value" Is a Myth

When critics say Bitcoin has "no intrinsic value," they're using a concept that doesn't exist.

Nothing has intrinsic value:
- **Gold**: Valued because humans choose to value it. Its "industrial uses" came after millennia of monetary use.
- **Dollars**: Paper with no material value. Valued because people accept it.
- **Real estate**: Valued by humans who want to live or work somewhere.
- **Food**: Valued by hungry humans. Worthless to a corpse.

The question isn't whether Bitcoin has intrinsic value (nothing does). The question is whether people will continue to value Bitcoin's properties.

## Bitcoin's Subjective Value

Bitcoin is valued for its properties:

| Property | Why It's Valued |
|----------|-----------------|
| Scarcity | 21 million cap provides certainty |
| Portability | Send any amount anywhere instantly |
| Divisibility | Split into 100 million satoshis |
| Durability | Can't degrade, can't be destroyed |
| Verifiability | Anyone can verify authenticity |
| Sovereignty | No one can seize or censor it |

These properties are objectively verifiable. But their **value** is subjective — it depends on individuals choosing to value them.

Millions of people have decided these properties are valuable. That's why Bitcoin has a price.

## The Implications

Understanding subjective value has profound implications:

### 1. Central Planning Fails

If value is subjective and dispersed across millions of minds, no central planner can calculate "correct" prices. This is why socialist economies struggled with chronic shortages and surpluses.

### 2. Price Is Information

Prices aggregate the subjective values of all market participants. A rising price signals that more people value something more highly. A falling price signals the opposite.

### 3. "Fair Price" Is Meaningless

There's no objectively "fair" price. The fair price is whatever buyer and seller agree to. Any attempt to impose "fair" prices causes distortions.

### 4. Value Creation Through Exchange

When two people trade voluntarily, both benefit — otherwise they wouldn't trade. Value is created through exchange, not just production.

## The Honest Assessment

Subjective value theory has limitations:
- It doesn't tell us *why* people value things
- It can seem tautological (people value what they value)
- It doesn't predict future valuations

But it correctly identifies that value is not an objective property of objects. This matters for Bitcoin because:

1. Bitcoin doesn't need "intrinsic value" to be valuable
2. Its value comes from people choosing to value its properties
3. The "backed by nothing" criticism applies equally to all money

The relevant question isn't whether Bitcoin has some mystical inherent value. The question is whether its properties will continue to be valued by humans — and that's something only time will tell.
