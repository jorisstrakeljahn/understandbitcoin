## The Invisible Heist Hiding in Plain Sight

In the 1730s, Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon noticed something about money that most economists still overlook: new money doesn't enter an economy uniformly, like a rising tide lifting all boats. It enters at specific points, flowing to specific people first.

When Spanish gold flowed from the New World into Europe, it didn't simultaneously appear in everyone's pockets. Miners, then ship owners, then merchants, then their suppliers received the gold in sequence. Each group spent the gold before prices fully adjusted to the increased money supply. By the time the gold reached peasants and workers - through wages slowly rising - prices had already increased. The early recipients gained purchasing power; the late recipients effectively lost it.

This observation - that money creation transfers wealth from later recipients to earlier recipients - is the Cantillon Effect. It was noticed three centuries ago, but it's never been more relevant than today.

## How Modern Money Creation Actually Works

Central banks don't print currency and scatter it from helicopters. That would at least be fair. Instead, modern money creation is a multi-stage process that consistently benefits certain parties before others.

The Federal Reserve creates money by purchasing assets - typically government bonds or mortgage-backed securities - from large financial institutions. These banks suddenly have new reserves they can lend or invest. They didn't earn this money; it was simply created and given to them first.

Banks then extend credit to their best customers: large corporations, wealthy individuals, and other financial institutions. These borrowers access newly created money at favorable rates, using it to buy assets - stocks, real estate, companies - before prices adjust to the increased money supply.

Only gradually does this money trickle into the broader economy. Companies invest, hire, and raise wages. Suppliers receive payments. Eventually, some portion reaches ordinary workers and consumers. But by this point, asset prices have already risen substantially. The house that cost $200,000 before the money was created now costs $400,000. The workers' wages might have increased 20%. The math doesn't work in their favor.

Consider the concrete timeline of a trillion-dollar money creation event. On day one, large banks receive the new reserves and immediately deploy them in financial markets. Within the first week, hedge funds and corporations access cheap credit, bidding up asset prices. Over the following months, companies invest and hire, with some money flowing to employees. Over one to three years, wages slowly rise. But housing, education, and healthcare prices have already increased far more.

Asset holders gained purchasing power. Wage earners lost it. Wealth transferred from the latter to the former - not through any explicit tax or theft, but through the invisible mechanism of monetary dilution.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Since 1971, when the US completely abandoned the gold standard, we can trace the Cantillon Effect through diverging prices.

| Asset | Change Since 1971 |
|-------|------------------|
| S&P 500 | +4,000% |
| Real estate prices | +1,500% |
| Gold | +5,000% |
| Real median wage | +7% |

Read that last number again. Real median wages - what the typical worker can actually buy with their pay - have barely budged in over fifty years. Meanwhile, the assets that the wealthy disproportionately own have increased in value by thousands of percent.

This divergence accelerated dramatically after 2008, when central banks began unprecedented quantitative easing programs. It accelerated again after 2020, when trillions of dollars were created in response to the pandemic. Each wave of money creation flowed first to those closest to the financial system, bidding up asset prices before workers' wages could adjust.

If you owned stocks and real estate in 2020, you're substantially wealthier now, at least on paper. If you earned a wage and tried to save for a house, you've been running on a treadmill moving backwards.

## The Geography of Money Creation

Think about who is physically and institutionally close to the money printer, and who is far from it.

Those who benefit first include central bankers and their institutions, the large banks that receive new reserves directly, corporations with sophisticated treasury operations and credit access, asset owners who see their holdings appreciate, and wealthy individuals who can borrow against assets at favorable rates.

Those who lose out include savers holding cash while purchasing power erodes, workers whose wages lag behind price increases, first-time homebuyers watching prices rise faster than they can save, small businesses far from cheap credit, retirees on fixed incomes, and future generations who inherit inflated prices and debts.

This isn't a conspiracy. No one gathered in a room to design a system that transfers wealth upward. It's simply how the mechanics of modern money creation work. Money enters at the top and flows down, with value extracted at each stage.

## Why This Effect Remains Politically Invisible

The Cantillon Effect is one of the largest wealth transfers in history, yet it rarely features in political debate. Several factors keep it hidden.

The beneficiaries write the rules. Those who gain from money creation have disproportionate political influence. They're not inclined to publicize a mechanism that benefits them.

The mechanism is invisible. No one takes your money. Your wallet has the same number of dollars. You just can't buy as much with them. Inflation feels like "prices going up," a force of nature, rather than "purchasing power being transferred from you to others."

The timeline is long. The effect plays out over years and decades. It's hard to connect cause and effect across such spans. By the time your house is unaffordable, the money creation that caused it happened years ago.

The explanation is technical. Understanding the Cantillon Effect requires grasping how money creation actually works - something most economics courses don't emphasize. It's easier to blame visible factors like greedy landlords or lazy workers.

## The Bitcoin Alternative

Bitcoin eliminates the Cantillon Effect by design.

| Fiat Money | Bitcoin |
|------------|---------|
| New supply created by central bank decision | New supply follows fixed schedule |
| First recipients are large financial institutions | Mining is open to anyone willing to compete |
| Unpredictable quantity based on policy decisions | Predictable, auditable, verifiable supply |
| Benefits those closest to money creation | No privileged access to new bitcoin |

When you hold bitcoin, no one can dilute your holdings by creating more. The 21 million cap is enforced by code running on thousands of independent computers, not by policy promises from officials who benefit from breaking them.

New bitcoin does enter circulation through mining, but the process is radically different from fiat money creation. Anyone with sufficient hardware and electricity can mine - no relationship with the Fed required. The supply schedule is known decades in advance. And the total that will ever exist is fixed, meaning each bitcoin represents a constant share of the total supply.

This doesn't make bitcoin a perfect money. It has other trade-offs - volatility, complexity, energy consumption. But it does eliminate the particular injustice of the Cantillon Effect: the hidden transfer of wealth from those far from money creation to those close to it.

## The Honest Counterarguments

Not everyone accepts the Cantillon Effect as a primary driver of inequality.

Mainstream economists argue that central bank money creation is necessary for economic stability. Without the ability to expand money supply during crises, recessions would be deeper and more painful. The benefits of monetary flexibility, they claim, outweigh distributional concerns.

The transmission mechanism is complex. Not all created money flows into consumer prices or asset markets. Some stays in financial system reserves. The link between money creation and specific price increases is difficult to trace precisely.

Inequality has multiple causes. Technology, globalization, tax policy, education access, and many other factors contribute. Attributing inequality primarily to monetary policy may oversimplify a complex phenomenon.

These points deserve consideration. The exact magnitude of wealth transfer through the Cantillon Effect is genuinely uncertain. But the core observation remains: new money benefits first recipients, and in our system, first recipients are consistently the already-wealthy.

## The Bottom Line

The Cantillon Effect describes how money creation transfers wealth from late recipients to early recipients. In modern economies, this means from workers and savers to banks, corporations, and asset owners.

This isn't a theory about intentions. Central bankers aren't trying to enrich the wealthy. They're trying to manage the economy using the tools they have. But the tools themselves have distributive effects that are rarely acknowledged.

Understanding the Cantillon Effect helps explain why wages haven't kept up with asset prices, why young people struggle to buy homes their parents bought easily, and why inequality has widened even as economies grew. It's not the only factor, but it's a significant one that operates continuously, invisibly, through the basic mechanics of how modern money is created.

Bitcoin offers an alternative where this particular effect cannot occur. Whether the world will adopt such an alternative remains to be seen. But understanding why some people advocate for it requires understanding what they're trying to escape.
