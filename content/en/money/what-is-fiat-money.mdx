## Money By Decree

"Fiat" is Latin for "let it be done" - a command, a decree. Fiat money is money because the government says so, not because it has inherent value or represents a claim on something valuable.

When you hold a dollar bill, you're holding a piece of paper that costs approximately 7 cents to produce. It's valuable not because of what it is, but because of what it represents: a promise backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.

This promise has three legs. The government accepts dollars for taxes, creating guaranteed demand. Legal tender laws require creditors to accept dollars for debts, making them universally usable. And everyone else accepts them because everyone else accepts them - a self-reinforcing social convention.

There's no gold, silver, or any other commodity backing the dollar. You cannot walk into a bank and exchange your dollars for a fixed amount of precious metal. The paper is worth what people believe it's worth, which is entirely a function of trust in the issuing authority.

Every major currency in the world today operates on this basis. The dollar, euro, yen, pound, yuan - all are fiat currencies, backed by nothing but confidence in their issuing governments.

## The Long Road From Gold to Promises

Humanity didn't start with fiat money. For most of history, money was either a commodity (like gold or silver coins) or a claim on a commodity (paper notes redeemable for gold).

This constrained governments. You can't print gold. If you want more money, you need to mine more metal or confiscate it from someone else. This limit felt oppressive to governments that wanted to fund wars, public works, or political favors without the inconvenience of explicit taxation.

The transition happened gradually. Before 1914, major currencies operated under the classical gold standard. A British pound or American dollar represented a specific weight of gold you could claim from the bank. International trade flourished because merchants could trust the value of currencies backed by something real.

World War I broke this system. Governments suspended gold convertibility to print money for the war effort. Armies don't pay themselves with balanced budgets. After the war, attempts to restore the gold standard proved unstable - countries couldn't maintain fixed exchange rates while pursuing independent monetary policies.

The Bretton Woods system after World War II created a compromise. The dollar was pegged to gold at $35 per ounce. Other currencies were pegged to the dollar. This worked while US gold reserves remained adequate to back the dollars in circulation.

By the late 1960s, the system was straining. The US had printed more dollars than its gold could cover. Foreign governments, particularly France, began demanding gold in exchange for their dollar holdings. On August 15, 1971, President Nixon closed the gold window, ending dollar-gold convertibility.

From that moment, the world has run on pure fiat. No major currency has commodity backing. Money is entirely a function of government decree and public trust.

## The Mechanics of Modern Money Creation

Fiat money isn't printed and distributed uniformly. Its creation is a complex process that flows through specific channels to specific recipients.

Central banks like the Federal Reserve create money by purchasing assets - typically government bonds or mortgage-backed securities. When the Fed buys a bond from a bank, it pays with newly created reserves that didn't exist before. The bank's account at the Fed shows a higher balance; the money came into existence through accounting entry.

Commercial banks create money through lending. When a bank makes a loan, it doesn't take money from a vault and give it to the borrower. It creates a deposit in the borrower's account, which the borrower can spend. This money also didn't exist before the loan was made. Through this fractional reserve process, commercial banks create most of the money in circulation.

Governments spend money into existence through fiscal deficits. When the government spends more than it taxes, the difference is covered by borrowing. The central bank often purchases this debt, effectively monetizing it. The spending enters the economy as new money.

There is no physical limit to any of these processes. Money can be created with keystrokes, in any quantity, at any time, subject only to the judgment of those controlling the process.

## What Fiat Money Does Well

Defenders of fiat money make arguments worth taking seriously.

Flexibility is the primary advantage. When economies contract, central banks can expand money supply to stimulate activity. When pandemics hit, governments can fund emergency responses without waiting to accumulate savings. This crisis response capability has moderated some business cycle severity.

Commodity money had real problems. The gold standard era featured severe deflations when gold supply didn't keep pace with economic growth. Prices fell, debtors defaulted, banks failed. The Great Depression was exacerbated by countries' adherence to gold standard rules.

Modern economies are complex. The argument that elastic money supply helps manage complexity has some merit. Whether the benefits outweigh the costs is the real debate.

## What Fiat Money Does Poorly

Every fiat currency loses purchasing power over time. This isn't a side effect - it's policy. Central banks explicitly target 2% annual inflation. At that rate, money loses half its value every 35 years. The dollar has lost over 97% of its purchasing power since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.

Debt accumulates without natural limit. When governments can print money to cover deficits, there's no hard constraint on borrowing. US national debt now exceeds $34 trillion. Global debt exceeds $300 trillion. These figures are essentially unrepayable through normal means - they can only be inflated away or defaulted upon.

Moral hazard corrupts decision-making. When banks know they'll be rescued in a crisis, they take excessive risks. When governments know they can print their way out of problems, they make promises they can't keep through honest means. The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated this vividly - reckless institutions were rescued while ordinary people lost homes.

Wealth transfers invisibly from some groups to others. New money benefits those who receive it first - banks, governments, those with access to cheap credit. By the time money reaches wages, prices have already risen. This Cantillon Effect operates continuously, transferring purchasing power upward without explicit taxation.

The historical record is sobering. Every fiat currency eventually fails or suffers massive devaluation. The German Papiermark in the 1920s. The Zimbabwe dollar in the 2000s. The Venezuelan bolivar today. Even "stable" currencies like the dollar and pound have lost most of their value over decades. No fiat currency has lasted more than a few decades without significant devaluation; most have failed entirely.

## The Fifty-Year Experiment

Since 1971, humanity has run on pure fiat for the first time in history. The results are mixed.

We've seen unprecedented economic growth. We've also seen unprecedented debt accumulation. We've seen moderated business cycles in some periods. We've also seen massive financial crises - 1987, 2000, 2008, ongoing. We've seen living standards rise. We've also seen wealth inequality widen dramatically.

| Metric Since 1971 | Change |
|-------------------|--------|
| US national debt | From $400B to $34T+ |
| Dollar purchasing power | -85%+ |
| Stock market (S&P 500) | +4,000%+ |
| Real median wage | +7% |
| Wealth share of top 1% | Doubled |

These trends are correlated with fiat money. Whether they're caused by it is debated. But the pattern is consistent with what fiat critics predicted: debasement, debt, asset inflation outpacing wages, wealth concentration.

## Bitcoin as an Alternative

Bitcoin represents a different monetary model entirely.

Where fiat supply is unlimited, Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million. Where fiat is controlled by central authorities, Bitcoin is controlled by mathematical rules enforced by thousands of independent nodes. Where fiat requires trust in institutions, Bitcoin allows verification of everything by anyone.

| Dimension | Fiat Money | Bitcoin |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Supply limit | None | 21 million |
| Control | Central bank | Distributed consensus |
| Backing | Government promise | Mathematical rules |
| Trust requirement | High | Minimized |
| Transparency | Limited | Complete |

Bitcoin can't be printed to fund wars or bail out banks. It can't be devalued by decree. It doesn't require trust in institutions that have historically abused monetary power.

Whether this is better depends on your values. If you trust governments and central banks, fiat works. If you don't - or if you live in a country where such trust is impossible - Bitcoin offers an alternative that didn't exist before 2009.

## The Question Worth Asking

After fifty years of pure fiat, we have debt levels that can never be repaid normally, currencies that continuously lose value, financial systems that require periodic rescue, and wealth inequality that continues widening.

Fiat defenders say this is the cost of flexibility - problems that would be worse under inflexible commodity money. Fiat critics say these are predictable consequences of giving governments unlimited money-printing power, consequences that compound across decades.

Honest people disagree. But the question is worth asking: is this working? And if not, what are the alternatives?

Bitcoin exists because some people answered those questions and found fiat wanting. Whether they're right is something history will determine. Understanding what fiat money actually is - how it works, what it enables, what it costs - is essential for evaluating whether they might be.
