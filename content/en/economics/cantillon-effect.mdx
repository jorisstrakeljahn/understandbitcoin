tldr:
  - New money enters the economy at specific points, not uniformly
  - Those closest to the money printer (banks, governments) benefit first
  - By the time money reaches ordinary people, prices have already risen
  - This causes hidden wealth transfer from the poor to the wealthy
  - Bitcoin's fixed supply eliminates this effect
whyPeopleAsk: People sense that something is unfair about how money works — that the wealthy get richer while wages don't keep up. The Cantillon Effect explains why.
steelmanObjection: "This effect is overstated. Central bank money mostly stays in the financial system. Real economy inflation comes from fiscal spending and supply issues, not money creation."
whatIsTrue:
  - New money does enter the economy at specific points
  - Those with first access to credit do benefit disproportionately
  - Asset price inflation has outpaced wage growth for decades
  - This effect was observed and described as early as the 1730s
whatIsUncertain:
  - The exact magnitude of wealth transfer
  - How much inequality is caused by this versus other factors
  - Whether alternative monetary systems would be more equitable

## The Original Insight

In the 1730s, Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon observed something about money that economists still debate today: **new money doesn't enter an economy uniformly**.

When a gold mine opens, Cantillon noticed:
1. Mine owners and workers get the new gold first
2. They spend it on goods they want
3. Merchants and suppliers receive the gold next
4. Prices rise in their sectors
5. Eventually everyone has more gold
6. But prices have already risen, neutralizing much of the benefit for latecomers

The first recipients benefit at the expense of the last.

## How It Works Today

Modern money isn't gold from mines — it's credit created by central banks and commercial banks. But the same principle applies.

### The Money Creation Process

1. **Central bank creates reserves** (e.g., through quantitative easing)
2. **Large banks receive money first** — they can lend and invest immediately
3. **Corporations and the wealthy access credit** — often at favorable rates
4. **Assets prices rise** — stocks, real estate, bonds appreciate
5. **Eventually, some money reaches consumers** — through wages, slowly
6. **By then, prices have already risen** — houses, education, healthcare cost more

The wealthy own assets that appreciate. The poor earn wages that lag behind.

## A Concrete Example

Imagine the central bank creates $1 trillion in new money:

**Day 1**: Large banks receive the money. They buy government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Asset prices rise immediately.

**Week 1**: Hedge funds and corporations access cheap credit. They buy stocks and real estate. Prices rise further.

**Month 1-6**: Companies invest, hire, raise prices to cover costs. Some money flows to employees.

**Year 1-3**: Wages slowly rise. But housing, education, and stock prices have already increased far more.

**Result**: Asset holders gained purchasing power. Wage earners lost it. Wealth transferred from the latter to the former.

## The Data

This isn't just theory. Look at the patterns:

| Since 1971 (off gold standard) | Change |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| S&P 500 | +4,000% |
| Real estate prices | +1,500% |
| Gold | +5,000% |
| Real median wage | +7% |

Wages barely moved. Asset prices exploded.

This divergence accelerated after 2008 and especially 2020, when unprecedented money creation occurred.

## Who Benefits and Who Loses

### Benefits First
- Central bankers and their institutions
- Large banks receiving new reserves
- Corporations with access to cheap credit
- Asset owners (stocks, real estate, bonds)
- Wealthy individuals who can borrow

### Loses
- Savers in cash (purchasing power erodes)
- Workers whose wages lag inflation
- First-time homebuyers (prices rise faster than savings)
- Anyone far from the "money printer"
- Future generations (inherit inflated prices)

## The Political Dimension

This effect is rarely discussed in mainstream politics because:

1. It benefits those who write the rules
2. It's invisible — no one "takes" your money
3. It happens slowly, across years and decades
4. It's technically complex to explain

Yet it may be the largest wealth transfer in history.

## Bitcoin as a Solution

Bitcoin eliminates the Cantillon Effect by design:

| Fiat Money | Bitcoin |
|------------|---------|
| New supply created by central banks | New supply follows fixed schedule |
| First recipients benefit | No "first recipients" — mining is open |
| Unpredictable quantity | Predictable, auditable supply |
| Benefits those close to power | No privileged access |

When you hold bitcoin, no one can dilute your holdings by printing more. The 21 million cap is enforced by code, not policy.

## The Critique

Not everyone accepts this analysis:

**Mainstream view**: Central bank money creation is necessary for economic stability. The benefits (employment, growth) outweigh distributional concerns.

**Complexity argument**: Money creation effects are complex. Attributing inequality primarily to money printing oversimplifies.

**Counterfactual**: Without money creation, recessions might be worse, hurting the poor more.

These points deserve consideration. But the core observation remains: new money benefits first recipients. Who those recipients are is a policy choice — and currently, they're mostly the already-wealthy.

## The Honest Assessment

The Cantillon Effect is real and documented. Its magnitude is debated. Whether eliminating it (through sound money) would be net beneficial is genuinely uncertain.

But the insight is powerful: **how money enters the economy matters**. It's not neutral. It creates winners and losers.

Bitcoin offers an alternative where no one has privileged access to new money creation. Whether the world will adopt such a system remains to be seen — but understanding why some advocate for it requires understanding the Cantillon Effect.
