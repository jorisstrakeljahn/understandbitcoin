tldr:
  - Satoshi chose 21 million as the hard cap — no one can create more
  - The last Bitcoin will be mined around 2140
  - Each bitcoin divides into 100 million satoshis — enough for global use
  - The cap creates digital scarcity, like gold's geological scarcity
  - This fixed supply is Bitcoin's core monetary innovation
whyPeopleAsk: People hear "21 million" and wonder why that number, whether it can change, and whether it's enough for a global currency.
steelmanObjection: "21 million is arbitrary and limiting. There won't be enough for everyone, and deflation will discourage spending. A flexible supply is better for an economy."
whatIsTrue:
  - 21 million is enforced by code and consensus, not by trust
  - Each bitcoin has 100 million satoshis — 2.1 quadrillion units total
  - The cap cannot be changed without majority consensus of all participants
  - This makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from fiat currencies
whatIsUncertain:
  - Why Satoshi chose exactly 21 million (never explicitly explained)
  - Whether a fixed supply works for a global economy
  - How Bitcoin's economy will function when all coins are mined

## The Magic Number

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This isn't a suggestion — it's enforced by the code that every Bitcoin node runs.

When Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin, this cap was a deliberate choice. Unlike every government currency in the world, no one can create more Bitcoin on demand.

## Why 21 Million Specifically?

Satoshi never explicitly explained the choice. The best guess, based on forum posts and code comments, is a combination of:

### Mathematical Elegance

Bitcoin's supply schedule:
- **Block reward**: Started at 50 BTC
- **Halving**: Every 210,000 blocks (≈4 years), reward cuts in half
- **Total sum**: 50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ... ≈ 21 million

The geometric series naturally converges to just under 21 million.

### Divisibility

21 million bitcoins × 100 million satoshis = 2.1 quadrillion units

That's enough for every human on Earth to own ~262,000 satoshis — plenty for a global economy.

### Unit Psychology

Satoshi seemed to consider how the unit would feel. In early posts, he discussed the possibility that 1 BTC could be worth considerable amounts, making satoshis the common unit for daily transactions.

## Can It Change?

Technically, the cap exists in the Bitcoin code, which is open source. Anyone could modify their copy to allow more than 21 million.

But that modified version wouldn't be Bitcoin. Here's why:

### Consensus Required

For any rule change to take effect, the majority of:
- Full nodes (must accept new blocks)
- Miners (must produce new blocks)
- Exchanges and users (must value the new chain)

...would all need to agree. If they don't, you've just created a fork that nobody uses.

### Economic Incentives

Who would agree to inflate their own holdings? Every Bitcoin holder has an interest in maintaining the cap. Changing it would be economic self-destruction for those who enforce the rules.

### History

Bitcoin has had contentious debates about other rule changes (block size, for example). The supply cap has never been seriously challenged — it's considered sacred.

## Is 21 Million Enough?

Critics worry 21 million is too few for a global currency. But Bitcoin doesn't work like physical gold.

### Divisibility Solves Scarcity

| Unit | Quantity | If 1 BTC = $1M |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Bitcoin | 21 million | $1,000,000 each |
| Millibitcoin (mBTC) | 21 billion | $1,000 each |
| Satoshi | 2.1 quadrillion | $0.01 each |

Even if Bitcoin became global money, there are enough units. You'd just use satoshis instead of whole bitcoins.

### Lightning Network

On Bitcoin's Lightning Network, you can send fractions of satoshis (millisatoshis). The unit limitation is really no limitation at all.

## The Supply Schedule

Bitcoin's issuance follows a predictable schedule:

| Date | Block Reward | Total Supply |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 2009 | 50 BTC | 0 → 10.5M |
| 2012 | 25 BTC | 10.5M → 15.75M |
| 2016 | 12.5 BTC | 15.75M → 18.375M |
| 2020 | 6.25 BTC | 18.375M → 19.6875M |
| 2024 | 3.125 BTC | 19.6875M → ~20.3M |
| ~2140 | 0 BTC | ~21M (final) |

Already, over 93% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist has been mined. The rate of new supply is now lower than gold's.

## What Happens When All Are Mined?

Around 2140, the last satoshi will be mined. What happens to miner incentives?

### Transaction Fees Take Over

Miners already earn transaction fees in addition to block rewards. As block rewards shrink, fees become the primary incentive.

If Bitcoin is widely used by 2140, fees should be sufficient to secure the network.

### Security Questions

Critics worry fees won't be enough. This is a legitimate unknown. But:
- Block rewards decline gradually, giving the fee market time to develop
- 2140 is over a century away — technology and usage patterns will evolve
- The market has strong incentives to solve this problem

## Why Fixed Supply Matters

The 21 million cap isn't arbitrary — it's the core of Bitcoin's value proposition:

### Digital Scarcity

Before Bitcoin, digital things were infinitely copyable. The 21 million cap creates genuine scarcity in the digital realm.

### Predictability

You know exactly how much Bitcoin exists and will ever exist. No central bank can surprise you with money printing.

### Sound Money

Every fiat currency can be (and is) inflated. Bitcoin cannot. This makes it "hard money" like gold — but with a harder guarantee.

### Verification

Anyone running a node can verify the total supply at any time. This transparency is unprecedented in monetary history.

## The Honest Assessment

The 21 million cap is:
- **Fixed by code and consensus** — extremely difficult to change
- **Sufficient for global use** — 2.1 quadrillion satoshis is plenty
- **Unprecedented** — no money in history has been this provably scarce
- **Experimental** — whether fixed-supply money works at scale is unproven

Critics raise valid concerns about deflation and the long-term security model. But the cap is Bitcoin's defining feature — without it, Bitcoin would be just another inflationary currency.

The world has unlimited currencies that can be printed without limit. It has one with a hard cap of 21 million.
