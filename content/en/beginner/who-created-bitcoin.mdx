## The Origin Story

On October 31, 2008, someone using the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" posted a whitepaper to a cryptography mailing list. The paper described "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System."

On January 3, 2009, Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block (the "genesis block"), embedding the headline: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

## The Disappearance

Satoshi communicated with early developers via email and forum posts until mid-2010. Their final known message, sent to a developer in 2011, said they had "moved on to other things."

They've never been heard from since.

## Who Might Satoshi Be?

Many candidates have been proposed:

- **Hal Finney**: Cryptographer, first person to receive Bitcoin from Satoshi
- **Nick Szabo**: Created "bit gold," a Bitcoin predecessor
- **Adam Back**: Invented Hashcash, used in Bitcoin's proof-of-work
- **Craig Wright**: Claims to be Satoshi (widely disputed)
- **A group**: Some believe it was a team effort

No candidate has been proven, and the mystery may never be solved.

## Does It Matter?

Satoshi's anonymity is arguably a feature:

1. **No leader to attack**: Can't arrest, threaten, or corrupt Bitcoin's creator
2. **No personality cult**: Bitcoin's value comes from its properties, not a founder
3. **Decentralization**: Satoshi proved you don't need to trust the creator

The network works the same whether Satoshi is alive or dead, one person or ten.

## The Satoshi Coins

Satoshi is believed to control about 1 million bitcoin (mined in Bitcoin's early days). These coins haven't moved since they were mined, leading many to believe Satoshi is either dead, lost the keys, or is committed to never spending them.
