title: Does Bitcoin waste energy?
summary: Bitcoin uses significant energy to secure the network, but whether this is "waste" depends on how you value Bitcoin's benefits.

tldr:
  - Bitcoin uses as much electricity as a small country (~120 TWh/year)
  - Energy is used to secure the network against attacks
  - A growing share comes from renewable sources
  - The "waste" judgment depends on whether you find Bitcoin valuable
  - Energy use doesn't automatically mean environmental harm
whyPeopleAsk: Headlines about Bitcoin's energy consumption are common and concerning. People want to understand if this is environmentally irresponsible.
steelmanObjection: "Bitcoin's energy consumption is equivalent to entire countries, releases millions of tons of CO2, and provides no benefit that couldn't be achieved more efficiently with traditional banking."
whatIsTrue:
  - Bitcoin does use substantial energy (comparable to countries like Argentina)
  - Mining produces CO2 emissions
  - Proof-of-work security is energy-intensive by design
  - Some mining uses fossil fuels
whatIsUncertain:
  - Exact carbon footprint (estimates vary widely)
  - Future energy mix trends
  - Whether alternatives like proof-of-stake offer equivalent security

## The Numbers

Bitcoin's network consumes approximately 120 TWh of electricity per year. For context:
- More than Norway (~120 TWh)
- Less than data centers globally (~200 TWh)
- About 0.5% of global electricity

## Why Bitcoin Uses Energy

Bitcoin's energy consumption isn't a bug - it's a security feature. The Proof-of-Work system requires miners to expend real resources (electricity) to add blocks to the blockchain.

This creates what's called "thermodynamic security" - attacking the network would require spending enormous amounts of energy, making attacks economically irrational.

## The "Waste" Question

Whether energy use is "waste" depends on your perspective:

### Arguments It's Wasteful
- Traditional banking uses less energy per transaction
- The same security might be achievable differently
- Some of this energy comes from fossil fuels

### Arguments It's Not Wasteful
- The comparison isn't transaction-based (Bitcoin secures $1T+ in value)
- It provides financial services to the unbanked
- It offers inflation-resistant savings
- Much mining uses stranded or renewable energy

## The Sustainability Picture

Recent data suggests Bitcoin mining is increasingly sustainable:
- ~60% of mining uses sustainable energy (industry estimates)
- Mining can monetize stranded energy (flared gas, remote hydro)
- Heat from mining can be repurposed (heating buildings, greenhouses)

## A Nuanced View

The honest answer is: Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, and whether that's justified depends on how much you value what Bitcoin provides.

If you think Bitcoin is useless speculation, any energy use is waste. If you think it's an important tool for financial freedom and sound money, the energy cost may be worth paying.

This isn't a technical question - it's a values question.
