tldr:
  - Time preference is your preference for goods now versus goods later
  - Low time preference leads to saving, investing, and building for the future
  - High time preference leads to immediate consumption
  - Inflation raises time preference by punishing savers
  - Bitcoin's fixed supply encourages low time preference thinking
whyPeopleAsk: Bitcoiners often discuss "low time preference" as a virtue. People want to understand what this means and why it connects to Bitcoin.
steelmanObjection: "Time preference is pseudo-scientific moralizing. Saving isn't always virtuous — sometimes spending now is the rational choice. The economy needs consumption, not just savings."
whatIsTrue:
  - Humans generally prefer present goods over future goods
  - Deferred gratification correlates with success (the marshmallow test)
  - Sound money historically enabled more future-oriented thinking
  - Inflation does encourage present consumption over saving
whatIsUncertain:
  - Whether time preference is primarily individual or culturally shaped
  - The causal direction between money and time preference
  - How much low time preference is optimal

## The Fundamental Choice

Every day, you make choices between now and later:
- Eat the cake now or save it for tomorrow?
- Spend your paycheck or invest it?
- Watch Netflix or learn a skill?

Your tendency toward one or the other is your **time preference**.

**High time preference**: You heavily discount the future. A dollar now is worth much more than a dollar later. You consume rather than save.

**Low time preference**: You value the future nearly as much as the present. You're willing to delay gratification for greater rewards later.

## Why It Matters

### The Marshmallow Test

In the famous Stanford experiment, children were offered a marshmallow now or two marshmallows if they waited 15 minutes. Those who waited showed more success later in life — better grades, higher income, better health.

This isn't about marshmallows. It's about the capacity to defer gratification.

### Civilization Is Low Time Preference

Every great achievement required someone to sacrifice present consumption for future benefit:

- **Farming**: Instead of eating seeds, plant them
- **Capital goods**: Build tools instead of hunting directly
- **Education**: Years of study before productive work
- **Infrastructure**: Build roads that benefit future generations

High time preference societies consume their seed corn. Low time preference societies build cathedrals they won't live to see completed.

### Interest Rates Reflect Time Preference

Why do lenders charge interest? Because they're giving up present use of money for future repayment. Interest is the price of time.

The natural interest rate in an economy reflects the aggregate time preference of all participants. Lower rates indicate more patience; higher rates indicate more impatience.

## Money Affects Time Preference

Here's the crucial insight: **the type of money you use affects your time preference**.

### Under Sound Money

When money holds its value:
- Saving is rewarded — your savings buy more later
- People think long-term
- Investment in productive capacity increases
- Time preference naturally lowers

The gold standard era saw massive infrastructure projects, cathedrals, institutions built to last centuries.

### Under Fiat Money

When money loses value through inflation:
- Saving is punished — your savings buy less later
- People think short-term
- Consumption is favored over investment
- Time preference rises

Modern fiat economies show shorter corporate time horizons, declining infrastructure quality, and the rise of disposable culture.

## Bitcoin and Time Preference

Bitcoin is designed to lower time preference:

| Property | Effect on Time Preference |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Fixed supply | No inflation to punish saving |
| Deflationary tendency | Your savings gain purchasing power |
| No central bank | No one can inflate your savings away |
| Long-term security | Can hold indefinitely without degradation |

Holding bitcoin encourages "HODL" behavior — holding through volatility for long-term gains. This is low time preference in action.

## The Critique

Not everyone agrees this analysis is correct:

**Economic argument**: Economies need consumption, not just savings. Too much saving can cause recessions (paradox of thrift).

**Moral argument**: It's not always virtuous to defer consumption. Sometimes enjoying the present is wise.

**Causal argument**: Does sound money cause low time preference, or do low-time-preference cultures choose sound money?

These are valid questions. The relationship between money and time preference is likely bidirectional, and optimal time preference isn't always "as low as possible."

## The Practical Implications

Understanding time preference helps explain:

1. **Why inflation matters**: It's not just about prices — it reshapes behavior toward short-term thinking

2. **Why Bitcoiners HODL**: The fixed supply makes holding attractive, training low time preference

3. **Why debt is dangerous**: High time preference (spending future income now) becomes culturally normalized

4. **Why saving feels hard**: When money loses value, saving seems irrational — because it is

## The Honest Assessment

Time preference is a powerful concept, but it can be overapplied. Not all consumption is "high time preference" and not all saving is virtuous. Context matters.

However, the core insight stands: the monetary system shapes our relationship with time. Sound money that holds value encourages long-term thinking. Inflationary money encourages short-term consumption.

Bitcoin, by design, is sound money for a digital age. Whether it will shift time preferences at a societal level remains to be seen — but the theory predicts it should.
