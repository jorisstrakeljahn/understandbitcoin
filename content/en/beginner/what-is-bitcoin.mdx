  - Bitcoin is digital money that doesn't need banks or governments
  - It runs on a global network of computers (nodes)
  - There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins
  - You control your money with private keys
  - Transactions are verified by miners and recorded on a public ledger
whyPeopleAsk: People often hear about Bitcoin in the news, from friends, or see its price fluctuating. They want to understand what it actually is beyond the hype and confusion.
steelmanObjection: "Bitcoin is just imaginary internet money with no intrinsic value. Unlike gold or dollars, it's not backed by anything real."
whatIsTrue:
  - Bitcoin is genuinely decentralized - no single entity controls it
  - The 21 million supply cap is enforced by code and consensus
  - Bitcoin has never been hacked (the protocol itself)
  - Thousands of nodes verify every transaction
whatIsUncertain:
  - Whether Bitcoin will become widely used as money
  - How governments will regulate it long-term
  - What the price will do in the short term

## The Short Answer

Bitcoin is a form of digital money that operates without any central authority. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by banks and governments, Bitcoin runs on a decentralized network of computers around the world.

## How It Works

When you send bitcoin to someone, the transaction is broadcast to the network. Thousands of computers (called nodes) verify that you actually own the bitcoin you're trying to send. Miners then group transactions into blocks and add them to a permanent, public record called the blockchain.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized**: No company or government controls Bitcoin
- **Limited supply**: Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist
- **Transparent**: All transactions are public and verifiable
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can use it without approval
- **Borderless**: Works the same anywhere in the world

## Why It Matters

Traditional money depends on trusting banks and governments. Bitcoin offers an alternative where the rules are enforced by math and code, not institutions. This matters particularly for people in countries with unstable currencies or limited banking access.

## Common Misconceptions

Many people confuse Bitcoin with blockchain (Bitcoin uses blockchain technology, but they're not the same thing). Others think it's anonymous (it's actually pseudonymous - transactions are public, but not directly tied to real names).
