tldr:
  - Value is not objective or inherent in things
  - The same object has different value to different people
  - Value comes from satisfying human wants, not from labor or materials
  - This explains why Bitcoin can be valuable despite being "just code"
  - Central planners can't determine "correct" prices because value is subjective
whyPeopleAsk: Critics say Bitcoin has "no intrinsic value." Understanding subjective value theory reveals why this criticism misunderstands how value works.
steelmanObjection: "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value — it's just code. Unlike gold (used in jewelry and electronics) or dollars (backed by government), Bitcoin is backed by nothing."
whatIsTrue:
  - No object has objective, inherent value
  - Value always depends on individual preferences and circumstances
  - Bitcoin's value comes from its monetary properties, not physical backing
  - All valuable things are valuable because humans value them

  - The long-term stability of Bitcoin's subjective valuation
  - Whether digital scarcity will be valued as highly as physical scarcity
  - How Bitcoin's value will evolve as adoption changes

## The Insight That Changed Economics

Before 1871, economists were stuck on a puzzle they couldn't solve. Adam Smith and Karl Marx championed the labor theory of value: a good's value came from the labor required to produce it. More labor meant more value. This seemed intuitive but created problems they couldn't explain away.

A mudpie requires labor but has no value. A diamond found lying on the ground has immense value despite requiring no labor. A life-saving surgery performed in minutes is worth more than years of digging ditches. The theory didn't work.

Carl Menger, working in Vienna, cut through the confusion with a radical insight: value doesn't exist in objects at all. Value exists only in human minds evaluating objects relative to their needs and circumstances. Things aren't valuable because of what they are or how they were made. They're valuable because someone values them.

This sounds almost tautological - things are valuable because they're valued - but it revolutionized economics and resolved puzzles that had plagued the field for centuries. It also explains why Bitcoin can have enormous value despite being "just code."

## Value Is Always a Relationship

Consider water. In itself, what is water's value? The question is meaningless without context.

To someone drowning, water has negative value - more is actively harmful. To someone comfortably hydrated, a glass of water is nearly worthless. To someone dying of thirst in a desert, that same glass is worth more than gold.

The water hasn't changed in any of these scenarios. Its chemical composition is identical. What changes is the relationship between the water and the person evaluating it. Value isn't a property of the water. It's a property of the relationship.

This applies to everything without exception. A painting by Picasso is worthless to someone who hates modern art, priceless to an enthusiast. A vintage car is worthless to someone who can't drive, valuable to a collector. A textbook is invaluable to a student studying for exams, worthless once the course is complete.

There is no "true" or "objective" value waiting to be discovered. Value is created in human minds when individuals evaluate objects relative to their specific circumstances, needs, and preferences.

## The Marginal Revolution's Key Insight

Menger's contribution went beyond identifying value as subjective. He also recognized that people don't value things in total - they value the next unit, the "marginal" unit.

The first glass of water after a desert crossing might be worth $1,000 to you. The second glass is worth less - you're no longer dying. The tenth glass that day might be worth only pennies. You're not valuing "water" as an abstract category. You're valuing this particular glass of water given your current situation.

This marginal utility concept solved the famous diamond-water paradox. Why are diamonds expensive when water is essential for life and diamonds are mere decoration?

The answer is that we value marginal units, not total categories. Water is abundant, so the next glass has little marginal value. We're saturated with water. Diamonds are scarce, so the next diamond retains significant marginal value. The total importance of water exceeds diamonds, but the marginal value of another diamond exceeds another glass of water.

## Why "Intrinsic Value" Is a Fiction

When critics say Bitcoin has "no intrinsic value," they're wielding a concept that, properly understood, applies to nothing that exists.

Gold doesn't have intrinsic value. It's a yellow metal that doesn't rust. Humans have chosen to value it for millennia, primarily for monetary purposes. Its industrial uses came much later - people valued gold for money long before they valued it for electronics.

Dollars don't have intrinsic value. They're paper with ink on them. Their value comes entirely from people accepting them in exchange and governments demanding them for taxes.

Real estate doesn't have intrinsic value. Land is dirt and rocks. Its value comes from humans wanting to live or work on particular pieces of dirt, subject to location, zoning, and countless other human factors.

Food doesn't have intrinsic value. Its value comes from hungry humans who need it. To a corpse, food is worthless.

Nothing has intrinsic value. Value is always a relationship between an object and a valuing mind. The question isn't whether Bitcoin has intrinsic value - the question is whether people will continue to value its properties.

## Bitcoin's Value Is Subjective - Like Everything Else

Bitcoin is valued for specific properties that people have decided are worth paying for.

Its scarcity is verifiable. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, enforced by mathematics and verified by anyone running a node. People who want scarce assets value this.

Its portability is unmatched. You can send any amount anywhere on Earth in minutes. People who need to move value across borders value this.

Its seizure resistance is unique. No government can freeze your bitcoin or seize it without your cooperation. People living under authoritarian regimes or concerned about asset seizure value this.

Its censorship resistance is real. No one can prevent your transactions if you're willing to pay fees. People who need uncensorable transactions value this.

These properties are objectively verifiable. Anyone can check whether Bitcoin actually has 21 million units, whether it's actually possible to send it globally, whether it's actually resistant to seizure. The properties themselves are facts.

But the value of those properties is subjective. It depends on individuals choosing to value them. Millions have. That's why Bitcoin has a price.

| Property | Objective Verification | Subjective Value |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| 21 million cap | Verifiable by any node | Valued by those who want scarcity |
| Global portability | Verifiable by sending transaction | Valued by those who need to move value |
| Seizure resistance | Verifiable by possession of keys | Valued by those seeking asset protection |
| Censorship resistance | Verifiable by network participation | Valued by those needing unstoppable transactions |

## What This Means for Central Planning

The subjective theory of value has implications far beyond Bitcoin. It explains why central planning consistently fails.

If value were objective - if things had inherent, measurable worth independent of human minds - then smart planners could theoretically calculate optimal production and prices. They could determine that society needs X amount of steel, Y amount of bread, Z amount of housing, and produce exactly those amounts.

But value is subjective, dispersed across billions of minds, and constantly changing based on circumstances. There is no "correct" price for a loaf of bread. There's only the price that emerges when buyers and sellers negotiate based on their individual valuations.

Central planners can't access the information needed to set prices correctly because that information exists only in individual minds, changes constantly, and is often tacit - people know what they value without being able to articulate it precisely.

This is why Soviet stores simultaneously had goods nobody wanted and shortages of goods people desperately needed. The planners weren't stupid. They simply couldn't access the dispersed knowledge that market prices aggregate.

Market prices are information. They tell producers what consumers value, in what quantities, at what trade-offs. That information doesn't exist anywhere except in the price system itself. Destroy the price system, and you destroy the information.

## The Question That Actually Matters

When skeptics say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, the correct response isn't to claim Bitcoin does have intrinsic value. Nothing does. The correct response is to ask the right question.

The relevant question isn't whether Bitcoin has some mystical inherent worth. The relevant question is: will people continue to value Bitcoin's properties?

Will scarcity in a world of monetary inflation remain valuable? Will the ability to move wealth across borders remain valuable? Will assets that can't be seized remain valuable? Will uncensorable transactions remain valuable?

These are genuinely uncertain questions. Maybe the world will become so peaceful and trusting that censorship resistance is unnecessary. Maybe governments will become so responsible that sound money offers no advantage over managed fiat. Maybe some technology will replace Bitcoin's properties with something better.

But as long as some people value these properties, Bitcoin will have value. Just like gold. Just like dollars. Just like everything else humans have ever valued.

## The Bottom Line

Value doesn't exist in objects. It exists in the minds of people evaluating objects relative to their circumstances and preferences. This insight, developed by Carl Menger in 1871, resolves the confusion about why diamonds cost more than water and why Bitcoin can be valuable despite being intangible code.

Bitcoin has value because people value its properties: scarcity, portability, seizure resistance, censorship resistance. These properties are objectively verifiable. Their value is subjectively determined by millions of individuals who have decided they're worth paying for.

The "no intrinsic value" criticism of Bitcoin applies equally to everything. Gold doesn't have intrinsic value. Dollars don't have intrinsic value. Real estate doesn't have intrinsic value. Nothing does.

The question isn't whether value is intrinsic. The question is whether people will continue choosing to value the properties they currently value. That's unknowable in advance. But understanding the subjective nature of value clarifies what kind of question it actually is.

Bitcoin is valuable because people value it. The same is true of everything else.
