tldr:
  - Inflation means your money buys less over time
  - Official measurement (CPI) may understate real inflation
  - Main cause is money supply growing faster than goods and services
  - The hidden "inflation tax" transfers wealth from savers to debtors
  - Bitcoin's fixed supply is designed to be immune to inflation
whyPeopleAsk: Inflation affects everyone but few understand it well. People want to know why prices keep rising and whether Bitcoin protects against it.
steelmanObjection: "Moderate inflation is healthy for the economy. It encourages spending, reduces debt burden, and gives central banks policy flexibility. Deflation would be much worse."
whatIsTrue:
  - Prices have risen significantly over decades
  - Official CPI does understate some categories (housing, healthcare, education)
  - Money supply has grown dramatically, especially since 2008
  - Debtors benefit from inflation, savers lose
whatIsUncertain:
  - The "true" inflation rate vs official measures
  - Optimal inflation level (if any)
  - Whether Bitcoin will prove to be an inflation hedge long-term

## Two Definitions

### Definition 1: Rising Prices (Popular Usage)

In everyday speech, inflation means "prices going up." When groceries cost more than last year, that's inflation.

This is how governments measure it — tracking a basket of goods (the Consumer Price Index, or CPI) and reporting how much prices changed.

### Definition 2: Money Supply Expansion (Austrian Usage)

Austrian economists define inflation as "expansion of the money supply." Rising prices are the consequence, not the thing itself.

This distinction matters because:
- Prices can rise from supply shocks (oil crisis, pandemic)
- Prices can rise from money printing
- The cause matters for the cure

## The Mechanism

When more money chases the same goods, prices rise. It's supply and demand applied to money itself.

**Example:**
- Economy has $1 trillion and 1 trillion goods
- Average price: $1 per good
- Central bank prints $1 trillion more
- Economy now has $2 trillion and still 1 trillion goods
- Average price rises toward $2 per good

This simplifies reality (money doesn't distribute evenly, production changes), but the principle holds.

## Is Official Inflation Accurate?

The government reports CPI around 2-4% in normal times. But many feel their costs rise faster. Why?

### What CPI Misses

**Housing**: CPI uses "owners equivalent rent," not actual home prices. If houses cost 50% more, it barely shows up.

**Healthcare**: Quality adjustments mask price increases. You get "better" care, so the price increase is discounted.

**Education**: Tuition has grown 1,200% since 1980, far outpacing CPI.

**Asset prices**: Stocks, bonds, and real estate aren't in CPI. This is where newly printed money often flows.

### Alternative Measures

Some economists calculate "shadow statistics" showing much higher inflation. Others argue CPI overstates inflation because quality improves.

The truth is contested. But if your experience says 2% inflation is laughable, you're not alone.

## Who Benefits, Who Loses

Inflation is not neutral. It creates winners and losers:

### Winners

- **Debtors**: Debts are fixed in dollars. If dollars are worth less, debts are easier to pay.
- **Asset owners**: Real estate, stocks, gold — assets appreciate with inflation.
- **The government**: Tax brackets don't fully adjust. Inflation pushes people into higher brackets.
- **First receivers of new money**: Banks and those with access to cheap credit (Cantillon Effect).

### Losers

- **Savers**: Cash loses purchasing power. The "inflation tax."
- **Workers**: Wages typically lag behind prices.
- **Fixed-income recipients**: Pensioners on fixed payments lose purchasing power.
- **Future generations**: Inherit inflated prices and debt.

This is wealth transfer — from the prudent to the indebted, from the poor to the wealthy, from the future to the present.

## The "Inflation Tax"

When government prints money instead of raising taxes, it's functionally a tax on cash holders.

**Example:**
- You have $10,000 in savings
- Government prints 10% more money
- Your dollars buy ~10% less
- You've effectively lost $1,000 to "taxation by inflation"

Unlike explicit taxes, this is hidden. No vote, no receipt, no transparency. The money just buys less.

## The Mainstream Defense

Central bankers and mainstream economists defend moderate inflation:

**Lubricates the economy**: Small inflation makes wages easier to adjust (harder to cut nominal wages).

**Encourages spending**: If money loses value, you're incentivized to spend or invest.

**Eases debt burdens**: Helps debtors (including governments) manage debt.

**Provides policy room**: Central banks can cut rates more when inflation is higher.

These arguments have some validity. The question is whether the benefits outweigh the hidden costs.

## Hyperinflation: When It Breaks

When trust collapses, inflation can accelerate into hyperinflation:

| Country | Year | Peak Monthly Inflation |
|---------|------|------------------------|
| Hungary | 1946 | 41,900,000,000,000,000% |
| Zimbabwe | 2008 | 79,600,000,000% |
| Venezuela | 2018 | 2,700,000% |
| Weimar Germany | 1923 | 29,500% |

Hyperinflation destroys savings, contracts, and social trust. It typically happens when governments print money to fund deficits they can't cover otherwise.

Every fiat currency is vulnerable. It just hasn't happened to the dollar — yet.

## Bitcoin's Solution

Bitcoin offers absolute scarcity:

| Fiat | Bitcoin |
|------|---------|
| Unlimited supply | 21 million cap |
| 2%+ annual inflation | 0% long-term inflation |
| Supply controlled by humans | Supply controlled by code |
| Can change at any time | Cannot change (consensus required) |

If Bitcoin works as intended, it's money that can't be inflated. Your purchasing power can't be diluted by money printing.

## The Honest Assessment

Inflation is:
- **Real**: Your money buys less over time
- **Hidden**: It works like a tax but is never voted on
- **Redistributive**: Transfers wealth from savers to debtors
- **Contested**: Experts disagree on measurement and optimal rate

Bitcoin is:
- **Designed** to be immune to supply inflation
- **Volatile** in the short term (prices swing widely)
- **Uncertain** as a long-term inflation hedge (15-year track record)
- **Potentially** the solution — or potentially too volatile to serve this function

The thesis that Bitcoin protects against inflation is compelling in theory. Whether it works in practice over decades remains to be proven.
